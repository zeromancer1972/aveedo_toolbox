# The unofficial aveedo&reg; Toolbox

<img src="aveedo-logo.png" style="width:50%"/>

This is a private repository that tries to collect useful tips and trick, scripts and routines for application development on the famous <a href="http://aveedo.com" target="_blank">aveedo&reg;</a> platform by <a href="http://www.we4it.com" target="_blank">We4IT</a>.

This project is not maintained by We4IT - and especially it is not updated on a regular basis. It's primary for my own use in customer projects.

Feel free to fork it and contribute to it if you have something useful to share. Please post only tested stuff as I won't be able to check everything.
