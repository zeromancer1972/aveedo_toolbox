## formula.js

In this section we try to mimic @Formulas. We are aware of the existing SSJS formula inplementations but there is a downside to them: they wont work in the mobile app and on aveedo when it runs on a different platform other than Domino.

So keep in mind to better only use pure SSJS and Java.
